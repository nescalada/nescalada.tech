      'Nehuén joined our plant (Adient - Rosario) as a 2nd shift IT Analyst support, when the plant worked on a 2 shifts pattern. He managed his tasks working alone and supported the IT team to achieve several improvements over that period (Tenable vulnerability score < 10 in a sustainable way, savings by moving some "physical" licenses to "online", supporting the implementation of IT processes, etc). During a restructuring process to adjust the headcount to 1 shift, we offered Nehuén the possibility to become a Production IT Analyst as Engineer Support Specialist in order to "preserve" an excellent person and professional within our team. While working in this area he was a key piece to drive improvements, as he developed several tools to gather relevant information from the process that helped identify problems. He also contributed to a more LEAN management of audits (layered process audits, 5S\'s, Visual Management, etc), and to keep Quality, Safety and Environmental Management Systems up to date (including the tracking of global procedures changes and its implementations in the plant, training and/or leading different groups -operators, supervisors, management- depending on the processes involved). I want to highlight, especially, his customer oriented focus and his willing to learn',
